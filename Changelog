version 0.02 (2009-04-16)

    - let's call POE::Kernel->alarm_remove_all() when disconnecting from job servers
      because there might be delayed events set up by task callbacks (callbacks are
      run within PoCo::TCP::Client sessions, so the user can't call alarm_remove_all)

version 0.01 (2009-04-09)

    - new
